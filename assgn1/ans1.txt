1.  man -k
    Description:
      I found this command by reading the manual of `man`.

2.  mv: '/usr/local/cs/bin/mv'
    sh: '/usr/bin/sh'
    Description:
      ``` session
      $ which mv  # locate `mv`
      $ which sh  # locate `sh`
      ```

3.  `pr` and `tr`
    Description:
      ``` session
      $ find /usr/local/cs/bin -executable -name "?r"
      ```

4.  /usr/bin/emacs-24.3
    Description:
      ``` session
      $ readlink -e /usr/bin/emacs
      ```

5.  The version number of `/usr/bin/gcc` is "4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.-36)"
    The version number of `gcc` is "8.2.0"
    Description:
      They are different because the former is the GCC executable at
      '/usr/bin/gcc' while the latter is a symbolic link at
      '/usr/local/cs/bin/gcc' to the GCC executable at
      '/usr/local/cs/gcc-8.2.0/bin/gcc'.
      Use '--version' flag to display the version of a GCC.

6.  u+sx: grant the owner execution permission and set the user id on execution
    o-w : remove other users writing permission
    Description:
      Their meaning of 'uoga' '+-=' & 'rwxXst' are specified in `man chmod`.

7.  `find /usr/local/cs -mtime -28 -type d`
    Results:
      /usr/local/cs
      /usr/local/cs/src/bison
      /usr/local/cs/src/bison/RCS
      /usr/local/cs/src/grep
      /usr/local/cs/src/grep/RCS
      /usr/local/cs/src/ocaml
      /usr/local/cs/src/ocaml/RCS
      /usr/local/cs/share/info
      /usr/local/cs/share/man/man1
      /usr/local/cs/share/man/man3
      /usr/local/cs/bin
      /usr/local/cs/.del
      ...
    Description:
      In `man find` I found following information:
      `-mtime n` requires that file's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.
      Numeric arguments can be specified as '+n' for greater than n, '-n' for 
      less then n, 'n' for exactly n. Notice that for `-atime` and `-mtime` 
      options, any fraction part is ignored.

8.  Of the files in this directory, 292 sybolic links are found.
    Description:
      By `which find` command, the directory that contains `find` is 
      '/usr/bin'. Then find all the simbolic links in the '/usr/bin' and count 
      the lines with `wc -l`.
      ``` shell
      $ which find
      $ find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l
      ```

9.  'librom1394.so.0.3.0'
    Description:
      Use `ls` command to list all files (-a) sorted by last modified time (-t)
      in reverse order (-r), and show only the first line using `head -n 1`
      command.
      ``` shell
      $ ls /usr/lib64 -tar | head -n 1
      ```

10. '/usr/lib/locale'
    Description:
      By reading `man 7 locale` under 'ENVIRONMENT -> LOCPATH', it is clear
      that if LOCPATH is set, compiled locale data files from `LOCPATH` and the
      system default locale data path are used; otherwise, only the ones from
      the system default locale data path are used. Since $LOCPATH is not set,
      according to `man 7 locale` section 'FILE', the default path 
      `/usr/lib/locale` is used.
      ``` shell
      $ man locale
      $ man 7 locale
      $ echo $LOCPATH
      ```

11. `downcase-dwim` `downcase-region` `downcase-word`
    Description (emacs keystrokes):
      <C-h> a d o w n c a s e

12.
    <C-M-r>
      isearch-backward-regexp: Do incremental search backward for regular
      expression. With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
      Like ordinary incremental search except that your input is treated
      as a regexp.
    <C-M-s>
      isearch-forward-regexp: Do incremental search forward for regular
      expression. With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
      Like ordinary incremental search except that your input is treated
      as a regexp.
    <C-M-t>
      transpose-sexps: Like C-t ('transpose-chars'), but applies to sexps.
      Unlike 'transpose-words', point must be between the two sexps and not
      in the middle of a sexp to be transposed.
    <C-M-u>
      backward-up-list: Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
      This command will also work on other parentheses-like expressions
      defined by the current language mode.  With ARG, do this that
      many times.  A negative argument means move forward but still to
      a less deep spot.  If ESCAPE-STRINGS is non-nil (as it is
      interactively), move out of enclosing strings as well.  If
      NO-SYNTAX-CROSSING is non-nil (as it is interactively), prefer to
      break out of any enclosing string instead of moving to the start
      of a list broken across multiple strings.  On error, location of
      point is unspecified.
    <C-M-v>
      xterm-paste: Handle the start of a terminal paste operation.
    Description (emacs keystrokes):
      <C-h> k <keys-to-know>

13. According to emacs help, "<C-g> runs the command keyboard-quit (found in 
    global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in 'simple.el'.
    The keyboard-quit function Signal a 'quit' condition. During execution of
    Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an
    editor command, this simply beeps."
    Description (emacs keystrokes):
      <C-h> k <C-g>

14. `yank` reinserts ("paste") the last stretch of killed text.
    More precisely, reinsert the most recent kill, which is the
    stretch of killed text most recently killed OR yanked.  Put point
    at the end, and set mark at the beginning without activating it.
    With just C-u as argument, put point at beginning, and mark at end.
    With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recent kill.

15. Unlike `ls -l` which is a one-time command to check files in a directory,
    emacs `dired` provides user with interactive navigation functionality
    and the ability to edit a file. What these two command display are mostly 
    the same.

Q3. When "randline.py" is invoked on an empty file (e.g. /dev/null), an error
    is thrown since in `randline.chooseline` method, random.choice does not
    take an empty sequence as input.

Q4. There would be a syntax error in Python 3 on line 65 of "randline.py",
    because unlike exceptions in Python 2, exceptions in Python 3 are not
    iterable.

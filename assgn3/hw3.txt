Q1. The patch actually makes the performace of `ls` better, because it removes
    an if statement.

Q2. This patched version will have different behavior (i.e. output) with the
    GNU standard version. Hence, if a shell script depends on the output of
    `ls` with option -A, it might be broken because of this introduced
    inconsistancy.

Q3. When "randline.py" is invoked on an empty file (e.g. /dev/null), an error
    is thrown since in `randline.chooseline` method, random.choice does not
    take an empty sequence as input.

Q4. There would be a syntax error in Python 3 on line 65 of "randline.py",
    because unlike exceptions in Python 2, exceptions in Python 3 are not
    iterable.

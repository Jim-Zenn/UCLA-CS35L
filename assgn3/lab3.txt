1.  Grab Coreutils 8.29:
    ``` shell
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
    ```
    Grab its signiture and the GNU keyring:
    ``` shell
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
    ```
    Verify the signiture using gpg:
    ``` shell
    gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
    ```
    I get the following output:
    ```
    gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
    gpg: /u/eng/class/classqze/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
    gpg: Good signature from "Pdraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
    gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
    gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
    ```
    // TODO: explain the "not certified trusted signiture issue"

2.  I then use following commands to build the coreutils.
    ``` shell
    tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
    ./configure
    make
    ```
    I created a temporary directory
    ``` shell
    mkdir $HOME/temporary
    ```
    and add it to $PATH.
    ``` shell
    export PATH="$HOME/temporary/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
    I then install coreutils into that temporary bin directory
    ``` shell
    make DESTDIR=$HOME/temporary install
    ```

3.  I can reproduce the bug by executing the following commands
    ``` shell
    ls -a -A
    ls -A -a
    ```
    Under my home directory, I get following identical result,
    ```
    .              .bash_profile  .emacs.d  .pki             CS32
    ..             .bin           .gnupg    .profile         CS35L
    ._Set.cpp      .cache         .lesshst  .python_history  perl5
    ._Set.h        .ccache        .local    .ssh             temporary
    .bash_history  .config        .login    .vim
    .bash_logout   .cshrc         .logout   .viminfo
    ```
    As you can see, the bug exists.

4.  I then download the patch and apply it.
    ``` shell
    cd coreutils-8.29
    wget "https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?att=1;filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch;bug=30963;msg=10" -O coreutils-patch
    patch -p0 < coreutils-patch
    ```

    During the patch command, I get the following output:
    ```
    can't find file to patch at input line 23
    Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

    NEWS patching failed because the diff in the patch does not match the
    actual context in the NEWS file. Hence, the patch was rejected.

5.  Then I `make` again. The whole coreutils, including all the manuals, was
    rebuilt, where in fact only ls.c related files need to be built.

6.  Now I execute
    ``` shell
    src/ls -a -A
    src/ls -A -a
    ``` src/ls -a -A
    I get following results respectively

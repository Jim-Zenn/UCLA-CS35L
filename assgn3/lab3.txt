1.  Grab Coreutils 8.29:
    ``` shell
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
    ```
    Grab its signiture and the GNU keyring:
    ``` shell
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
    wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
    ```
    Verify the signiture using gpg:
    ``` shell
    gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
    ```
    I get the following output:
    ```
    gpg: Signature made Wed Dec 27 10:29:05 2017 PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
    gpg: /u/eng/class/classqze/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
    gpg: Good signature from "Pdraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
    gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
    gpg:                 aka "Pdraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
    gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
    ```
    // TODO: explain the "not certified trusted signiture issue"

2.  I then use following commands to build the coreutils.
    ``` shell
    tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
    ./configure
    make
    make all
    ```

3.  I can reproduce the bug by executing the following commands
    ``` shell
    ./src/ls -a -A
    ./src/ls -A -a
    ```
    I get following results respectively,
    ```
    # command: ./src/ls -a -A

    ```
    ```
    # command: ./src/ls -A -a
    .                 GNUmakefile            aclocal.m4      init.cfg
    ..                INSTALL                bootstrap       lib
    .mailmap          Makefile               bootstrap.conf  m4
    .prev-version     Makefile.am            build-aux       maint.mk
    .tarball-version  Makefile.in            cfg.mk          man
    .timestamp        NEWS                   config.log      po

    ChangeLog         TODO                   gnulib-tests
    ```
    As you can see, the bug exists.

4.  I then download the patch and apply it.
    ``` shell
    cd coreutils-8.29
    wget "https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?att=1;filename=0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch;bug=30963;msg=10" -O coreutils-patch
    patch -p0 < coreutils-patch
    ```

    During the patch command, I get the following output:
    ```
    can't find file to patch at input line 23
    Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?

    NEWS patching failed because the diff in the patch does not match the
    actual context in the NEWS file. Hence, the patch was rejected.

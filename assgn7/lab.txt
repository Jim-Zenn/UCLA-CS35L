1. I used vim to create the c program. The program is as follows:

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    printf("%.17g\n", cos(sqrt(3.0)));
    return 0;
}
```

2. I then compiled it with gcc, and see its dynamic libraries dependency using the 
following command:
```
gcc cos_sqrt.c -o cos_sqrt
ldd cos_sqrt
```

The output is as follows:
```
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffeb3f88000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f66cb2b3000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f66cb680000)
```

It shows that 3 dynamic libraries are used here.

3. To see what system calls my trivial program makes, I use strace command, and
writes its stderr output into 'strace.log'.

```

1) execve("./cos_sqrt", ["./cos_sqrt"], [/* 36 vars */])
This call executes cos_sqrt with its path as the first argument, and 36
environment variables. This is not related to any library.

2) brk(NULL) = 0x109e000
brk is used to set the end of the data segment to the value specified by its
first parameter `addr`.  However, here, the parameter is NULL. It doesn't make
sense at the first glance.  But reading the 'Linux notes' section of the 
`man brk` gives me some clue.

> ... the actual Linux system call return the new program break on success.  On 
failure, the system call returns the current break.

Since this brk system call to set the end of the data segment to NULL will
always fail, this call is likely used to check the current program break's
address. Which is 0x109e000. It is not related to any library as well.


3) mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) 
                                                                = 0x7ff7dac43000

mmap is used to create a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling
process. The starting addres for the new mapping is specified in the first
parameter addr, the second argument indicates the length of the mapping.

Here, the addr is set to NULL. According to `man mmap`, if the addr is NULL, 
then the kernel chooses the address instead. The length of the mapping is 4096;
The thrid argument specifies that the pages may be read or written; the fourth
argument requires the updates to the mapping are private; what's more,
this mapping is not backed by any file (MAP_ANONYMOUS, that's also why the fifth
argument, fd, is set to -1; it indicates no actual file is backing this
writing).

Essentially, what mmap does here is still part of the initialization and is not
related to any libraries yet.

4) access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

occess is used to check whether the calling process can access the given file.
The second parameter specifies which accessibility check(s) to be performed.
Here, this access call want ot see if the calling process has read access to
`/etc/ld.so.preload`; the return value indicates that this file simply does not
exists.

`/etc/ld.so.preload`, if exists, works like the LD_PRELOAD environmental
variable, but with less restriction. LD_PRELOAD is subject to the restriction
that it cannot execute setuid binaries due to security concerns; however, since
`/etc/ld.so.preload` is owned by root, is trusted to have no malicious binaries.

reference:
https://superuser.com/questions/1183037/what-is-does-ld-so-preload-do

Here, the ld linker is obviously checking if there is some dynamic library that
the root user demands to link before other libraries. Still this is not related
to any specific libraries yet.

5) open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

open opens the file at the given path, and returns a file descriptor.

Here `/etc/ld.so.cache` is being opened. To understand what is happening here, I
read `man 8 ld.so` and `man 8 ldconfig`. It turns out that `ld.so.cache` caches
the map from plain shared library names (e.g. libc.so.6) to the full path (e.g.
/lib64/libc.so.6).

The file is opened, so that ld can find the true locations of the required
shared libraries. The file is set to be read only, and will clase on execution.

6) fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=168106, ...}) = 0

fstat is used to return information about a file (specified by the file
descriptor) in a given buf.

Here, as is seen above, file descriptor 3 corresponds to the file
`/etc/ld.so.cache`. This system call checks its status for the reason we are
going to see in the following system call.

7) mmap(NULL, 168106, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7ff7dac19000

This is the second time we see mmap. Here, what mmap does is mapping the
`/etc/ld.so.cache` (fd=3) file to the virtual address space, so that the linker 
can scan through it.

8) close(3) = 0

close closes the file descriptor 3, so that 3 can be reused. Since the file is
already mapped onto the virtual address space.

Notice that closing the file descriptor WILL NOT unmap the region, according to
`man 2 mmap`. Hence, the program still have access to the file.

9) open("/lib64/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

This is the first system call that is related to a specific library. Apparently,
ld sees that libc.so.6 is required; hence the corresponding file is opened.
Again, the library is set to be read only, and will close on execution, which
makes sense.

Notice that now file descriptor 3 is assigned to "/lib64/libc.so.6"

10) read(3, 
   "\177ELF\2\1\1\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0\340$\2\0\0\0\0\0"..., 832)
                                                                          = 832
This system call reads 832 bytes from the `libc.so.6`. It is curious to me that
a number 832 is specified. Why does the read command only requires 832 bytes?

After some investigation, it seems that the first 832 bytes composes the ELF
header (ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format).

According to wikipedia, the header contains:
- Program header table, describing zero or more memory segments
- Section header table, describing zero or more sections
- Data referred to by entries in the program header table or section header 
  table

Also,

> The segments contain information that is needed for run time execution of the
file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. Any byte
in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and orphan bytes can
occur which are unowned by any section.

reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format

Hence, reading the header is crucial here given that the library is to be used.
This system call is therefore still related to libc.so.6.

11) fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=2151672, ...}) = 0
12) mmap(NULL, 3981792, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0)
                                                               = 0x7ff7da656000
13) mprotect(0x7ff7da818000, 2097152, PROT_NONE) = 0

These system calls need to be inspected together, so it can make more sense.
What happens on 11) and 12) should be similar to what happened in 6) and 7).
In short, the fstat gets the info of the library file.
Then, mmap maps the file onto a virtual address space, such that it can be
accessed later.

mprotect provides a way to alter the protection flag. The first parameter is the
address where protection alteration starts, and the second parameter is the 
length of the region.
Here, the chosen segment of memory is then rendered unaccessible by setting its
protection flag to PROT_NONE.
According to MSDN, this could be a technique to mitigate against exploitation of
heap overflows.

reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Memory/creating-guard-pages

However, there is something to notice here. Despite that the file is known to
have a size of 2151672 bytes (line 11), mmap requested a much larger address
space (3981792 bytes). I will try to make sense of it in the next system call.

 file begin [0x7FF7DA656000] + 0x020D4F8 = file end
(addr begin)                 + 0x03CC1E0 = addr end
                             + 0x01c2000 = prot begin
 prot begin [0x7FF7DA818000] + 0x2000000 = prot end
 file end   [0x7FF7DA8634F8]
 prot end   [0x7FF7DAA18000]
 addr end   [0x7FF7DAA221E0]

These calls are still dealing with libc.so.6.

14) mmap(0x7ff7daa18000, 24576, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
         MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x1c2000) = 0x7ff7daa18000
15) mmap(0x7ff7daa1e000, 16864, 
         PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0)
                                                           = 0x7ff7daa1e000
Despite my best effort, I was not able to decypher the mmaps here. However, one
thing is for sure: it is still maping libc.so.6 library into the virtual address
space, such that it can be used later.

16) close(3) = 0
This line closes the file descriptor for libc.so.6, meaning the program has
already get the part of library it requires for my trivial program.

17) mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) 
                                                                = 0x7ff7dac18000
18) mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) 
                                                                = 0x7ff7dac16000
These two lines are most likely used to assign some memory space for the
program, similar to malloc.

19-28) The rest of the program doesn't look like they have anything to do with
the dynamic linking process any more. Hence, I will stop the analysis at this
point.

In conclusion, line 4 through 7, prepares for dynamic linking, line 8 through 16
deals with libc.so.6 linking specifically.

4. With command:
```
ls /usr/bin | awk 'NR%101==005181694%101'
```
I get the following list
```
alsaucm
c++filt
cmuwmtopbm
db2rtf
dropdb
fc-query
get_moz_enUS.py
graphml2gv
gvfs-rename
idlj

pldd
po2oo
ppmtopict
rasttopnm
rpmdev-sha384
sgitopnm
startkde
testrb
usb-devices
xdriinfo
yum-builddep
```
Running `ldd` one each command is a hassle. Therefore I use a shell script to do
this job. The script is as follows:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# ldd_scan.sh

for x in "`ls /usr/bin | awk 'NR%101==505008404%101'`";
do
    ldd `which $x`
done
```

Note: not a dynamic executable is not counted as error, since it is not. The
binaries were generated with static linking.

The binaries which I got errors on are as follows:

1) /usr/bin/locate
error message:
   ldd: error: you do not have read permission for `/usr/bin/locate'
This is very straight forward, since the binary is owned by root, and I only
have execution permission, I am not allowed to inspect its shared library
dependency. (need read permission)

This is the only error I get.

6. Given the script, to generate a list of common shared library dependency is
not that hard. We can use the following command:

```
./ldd_scan.sh | grep ".so.*=>" | sed "s/(.*//g" | sort -u > dependencies.log
```

The list is as follows:

```

```

First I get that verion of `coreutils` with `wget`, decompress the file with 
`tar`, and build it.
``` shell
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
tar xf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz
cd coreutils-withbug/
./configure --prefix=$HOME/temporary/lab4
make
make install
```

An error would occur during install:
``` log
In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^~~~~~~~
In file included from utimecmp.h:25,
                 from utimecmp.c:25:
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens'
was here
 extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
            ^~~~~~~~
```

To fix this issue, use this patch and install again.
```
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter19/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff
cd coreutils-with-bug
patch < ../coreutils.diff -p0
make
make install
```

The issue was that `futimens` and `tee` functions used are not defined.
The patch make the source code use `coreutils_futimens` and  `coreutils_tee`
instead, which are present.

By using the command `sort --version`, I get the following output.
```

It shows that the GNU coreutils installed on lnxsrv09 is of version 8.30, which
is newer than 8.6. Hence, the GNU sort should be able to use multiple threads
to improve performance.

Now I generate a file containing 2^24 random single precision floating point
numbers.
